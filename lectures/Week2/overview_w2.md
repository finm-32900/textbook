# Week 2: Task Runners, Env Files, and Secrets

## Objectives

- Review [HW 1](../Week1/HW1.md):
  - Even with precise instructions, replicating results exactly is still hard. 
  - The manual data download step is one common source of error. In today's lecture,
  we'll learn how to automate the data download step, which will go a long way
  towards fixing this problem.
  - The test-driven development workflow is common workflow in the real world.
  Learning how to write and debug unit tests is an important career skill.
  - Lots of other coding classes restrict your coding to a single windows in a
  browser, like LeetCode. This course gives you a more realistic context for
  writing code.
  - Getting used to incorporating Git and GitHub into your workflow is also an
  important career skill. 
- [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) portion of [HW 1](../Week1/HW1.md):
    - Review this section of the HW. 
    - I will check this for completion. Everyone should make sure to complete these.
    - Learning GitHub is a core skill in this class. It is of upmost importance
    for an aspiring software developer or data scientist.
    - Future assignments will contain additional GitHub skill-building exercises. 
    These tutorials created by GitHub are a great resource, but I will augment these
    with some of my own exercises.
- Review "Virtual Environments" from [Week 1](../Week1/virtual_environments.md)
- Discuss [Build Systems and Task Runners](./what_is_a_task_runner.md)
- Discuss [HW 2](./HW2.md)
- Discuss Case Study: Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker
